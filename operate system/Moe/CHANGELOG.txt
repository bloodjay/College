CHANGELOG:

11/17/2014

11/30/2014
  - Created all the required functions
  - Created jobTable class
  - Created CPUScheduler class
  - Created memManager class
  
  *progress so far - a few jobs complete, but they only complete by
    messing around with the time slice. Need to figure out how to 
    fix time quantum problem so jobs don't exceed their max CPU time
